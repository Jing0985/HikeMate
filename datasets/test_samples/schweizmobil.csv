The ViaGottardo reaches the central Alpine pass from Chiasso in the south, from Schaffhausen in the northeast and from Basel in the northwest of Switzerland. There are many traces of these transport links to discover along the way.
          
          
                      The main route of the ViaGottardo followed the route from Basel over the Unteren Hauenstein and the Gotthardpass to Milan that was opened at the beginning of the 13th century. Its economic importance and ideological elevation as the lifeline of an independent Switzerland, make it an informative route on which to journey through the history and mythology of the country.
                    
                      Along the way, a cross-section of Swiss settlements and cultural landscapes open out in such neatness that they could not be hiked in any other way. Since time immemorial, the Jura and Mitteland as transport-landscapes have stood in the shadow of those highly symbolic monuments of the Gotthard transit: the Teufelsbrücke (Devil's Bridge) embodies the momentous opening-up of Central Switzerland in the Middle Ages; the Tremolastrasse, the groundbreaking engineered road through the Alps; the Gotthard Railway, the triumph of industrialization; the motorway tunnel, symbol of mass motorization and sunny holiday dreams and the NEAT, a future-oriented transfer of transit traffic from road to rail.","320 km","10’200 m","10’100 m","medium","medium

                      Hiking over passes is a special discipline with its own devotees. It’s not mountaineers seeking spectacular summit views or the satisfaction of conquering the mountain but hikers driven by curiosity who wend their way up the «Furggeln» or «Bocchette» passes. Because every pass holds the secret of the unknown on the other side. What’s on the map is not enough; the aim is to discover a new world with each valley – and to leave the old one behind.
                    
                      The Alpine Passes Trail strings together many of the most beautiful and impressive passes in the Graubunden and Valais Alps on one continuous route. The result is a challenging but fascinating Alpine hiking tour with 43 stages. One highlight follows another, from the Greina Plateau to the passes and lake landscape at the foot of the Dents du Midi. Clearly it’s not likely that all stages will be covered at one time – but it can be hiked in sections. One major advantage of hiking the passes is the opportunity to leave or join the route in any valley between two passes. And once you’ve trodden the entire route – you can claim that you’ve looked deep into the soul of the Graubunden and Valais mountain world.","695 km","47’100 m","49’200 m","difficult","medium

                      The Jura Crest Trail is considered the classic among national long-distance trails. Signalization of the route, starting at Zurich and ending just before Genève, began as early as 1905. It links two major Swiss towns and as the name suggests, leads over the Swiss Jura heights. This makes a sweeping arc towards the northwest, so those hiking this trail go a little round the bend – and over the language boundary!
                    
                      The route has a particular appeal as it’s always easy to keep track of. Then there are the far-ranging views of the Alps, Black Forest and the Vosges. And en route: craggy cliffs and deep ravines, springs and lakes with no visible outlets, tranquil forests and extensive meadows, encounters with wild life or flora. But apart from similarities, regional differences are waiting to be discovered: different styles of houses and villages or cuisine with distinctive tastes. The many mountain restaurants and «Maiteries» are ideal for sampling local specialities.","320 km","13’800 m","13’900 m","difficult","easy

                      The pilgrimage to the grave of St. James in Santiago de Compostela is one of the most important spiritual traditions in Europe. As part of the European Jakobsweg (Route of St. James), the ViaJacobi leads along the foot of the Alpine chain from the Bodensee to Genève – right across Switzerland. Chapels, churches and hostels are strung like pearls along the ViaJacobi and, together with a diverse cultural landscape, offer a fabulous hiking experience.
                    
                      While for some the emphasis is on the spiritual aspect of the pilgrimage, others simply enjoy the journey, which mostly leads along historic routes through regions along the fringe of the Alps. The medieval routes of the Jakobsweg were however not always clearly defined, stormy weather could often lead to last-minute changes. And so today, the ViaJacobi also offers the option of choosing between various paths or following them in succession. It was quite common for the pilgrims of yesteryear to make the pilgrimage more than once.","645 km","17’500 m","16’900 m","difficult","easy

                      As the name promises, the Alpine Panorama Trail offers many views of Alpine peaks as well as of the Mittelland and Jura. The trail leads from Rorschach on the Bodensee through the Appenzell region, Toggenburg, Central Switzerland, Emmental, the Schwarzenburg and Gruyère regions to the Lac Léman Riviera, ending in the metropolis of Genève.
                    
                      For most of the way, the route passes through farmland in the Alpine foothills, where dairy farming has long been tradition. Cattle grazing in pastures and cheese dishes served in mountain taverns are two constant companions on the Alpine Panorama Trail. Wine growing first begins to dominate the scene at Lac Léman (Lavaux, La Côte).
                    
                      Also typical of the Alpine foothills are the scattered settlements dating back to individual occupation of land by the Alemanni in the early Middle Ages. The widely-scattered homesteads in the Appenzell region and the individual farmsteads on the crests and in the crannies of the Napf region are perfect examples of the traditional agricultural landscape of Swiss Alpine foothills.","510 km","17’800 m","17’800 m","medium","easy
