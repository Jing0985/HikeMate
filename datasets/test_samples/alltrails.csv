The driveway is approx. 17 km long and you have to overcome almost 1400 meters in altitude. On the way there are several places to stop for a break that invite you to take a break. The upper section after the Schwarzwaldalp is pretty steep, so divide up your forces at the beginning, but the view from the Große Scheidegg lets you forget the agony of the last few kilometers. The Berghotel Grosse Scheidegg offers overnight accommodation. Then it goes on gravel slopes towards First. A mountain bike or trekking bike is recommended. On the way you have a wonderful view of Grindelwald, the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. Below the ridge it goes on steep asphalt paths from the mountain to Grindelwald. From Grindelwald it's first up on asphalt towards Kleine Scheidegg. After a third of the way, the journey continues on gravel roads. The last part will be pretty tough again, most of them will have to push the bike, but when you get to the top you will be rewarded with a wonderful view again. From the Kleine Scheidegg train station, the route takes you on wide gravel paths downhill to Wengen. In Wengen you drive under the underpass at the train station and drive on a steep but rel. wide zigzag path to Lauterbrunnen. From Lauterbrunnen a cycle path leads along the stream to Interlaken. After crossing Interlaken it goes over a railway bridge and from there over narrow paths along the lake towards Brienz, unfortunately these paths end and you have to continue on the main road to Brienz. From Brienz it goes along the shore of Lake Brienz and then on asphalt roads up towards Axalp. In Brienzerberg we leave the street, which is a little more busy, in a hairpin. It continues on an untravelled road to the Hinterburgseeli. Once at the top you will be rewarded for your efforts by a breathtaking view. From the lake, the path continues briefly on gravel and then back on asphalt. At the end of the road it goes over cow pastures and meadow hiking trails from Berg. The path is pretty bad and the bike has to be carried or pushed more often. After about 2 km it goes on, first on gravel and later on asphalt roads to Meiringen. On the descent there is a slightly longer dark tunnel, a light would be good!
