# HikeMate - A Trail Recommender System

developed by five M.Sc. Information Systems students from the University of MÃ¼nster.

Data Integration - Capstone Project - December 2023

## Overview

HikeMate is a trail recommender system to provide personalized trail recommendations in Switzerland.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

Our Trail Recommender System relies on trail data scraped from [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com), specifically focusing on Switzerland. We've set up a standalone Python project, [alltrails](./alltrails/), which scrapes the AllTrails JSON API.
