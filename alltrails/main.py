# a web scraping project by ahmad

# This script automates a multi-step workflow involving the execution of three Python scripts:
# 1. trail_ids_generator.py - Generates an Excel file containing unique trail IDs.
# 2. alltrails.py - Performs scraping based on the generated unique trail IDs.
# 3. csv_generator.py - Generates a CSV file for the scraped trails.

# Due to certain technical restrictions, the complete process cannot be fully automated in one go.

# To ensure a sufficient amount of data, please follow the manual steps below before executing this script.
# 1. Navigate to the 'trail_ids_grabber' folder and execute 'trail_ids_grabber.py' multiple times
#    until you have gathered a satisfactory number of trail IDs.
# 2. Once you have collected a good amount of trail IDs, you can now proceed to execute this script
#    python main.py
